## Status: `design`

This repository is being designed. There is no released package and nothing to install yet.

## What this is

Models, events, errors, capabilities and service descriptions. Every entity and event has a stable identifier and a schema version. This repository is the source of truth: if two SDKs disagree, the spec decides.

## The wider project

Funora is one contract implemented natively in several languages. You change the language,
not the mental model: `Client`, services, events, router, filters, middleware and the error
taxonomy mean the same thing everywhere.

| Repository | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [Funora](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora) | One contract, one set of test vectors, native SDKs per language. | `design` |
| [Funora-spec](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-spec) | The canonical contract every SDK implements. | `design` |
| [Funora-codegen](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-codegen) | Generates the boring, repetitive part of every SDK. | `design` |
| [Funora-conformance](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-conformance) | The test contract between languages. | `design` |
| [Funora-python](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-python) | Reference implementation of the Funora contract. | `design` |
| [Funora-javascript](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-javascript) | TypeScript source, JavaScript and type declarations on output. | `planned` |
| [Funora-java](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-java) | Java SDK. | `planned` |
| [Funora-dotnet](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-dotnet) | .NET SDK. | `planned` |
| [Funora-cpp](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-cpp) | C++ SDK. | `planned` |
| [Funora-c](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-c) | C SDK — the narrowest contract in the project. | `planned` |
| [Funora-docs](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-docs) | Documentation for every SDK, from one source. | `design` |
| [Funora-examples](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/Funora-examples) | End-to-end examples that CI actually runs. | `planned` |

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Funora-Develop/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

The most useful contributions right now are protocol observations, fixtures and
specification review — not implementation.
